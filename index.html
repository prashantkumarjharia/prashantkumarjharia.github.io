        <p>
            I'm an embedded systems engineer specializing in C++, system-level software, and Linux.</br></br>

            With a Computer Science degree, I'm passionate about exploring open-source technologies and operating system internals in my free time.</br></br>

            As a <strong>Senior Software System Designer</strong> at <strong>AMD</strong>, I develop validation tools for next-generation processors. My previous work at <strong>Harman</strong> and <strong>Tata Elxsi</strong> involved building automotive infotainment systems, including CarPlay, Android Auto, and in-vehicle networking solutions across Android, Linux, and QNX platforms.</br></br>

            I have extensive hands-on experience with open-source tools like BlueZ, oFono, and Automotive Message Broker (AMB). I've implemented system integration features using DBus, CommonAPI, and GLib for robust embedded communication.</br></br>

            I've built solid expertise in embedded development, application design, and projection technologies, proven across both semiconductor and automotive industries.</br></br>

            Currently, I focus on creating scalable, high-performance applications and frameworks, and I'm eager to collaborate on projects that push technical boundaries.</br></br>

            Let's connect… I love discussing tech, systems, and innovation.
