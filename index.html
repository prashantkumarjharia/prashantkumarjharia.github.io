        <p>I am currently working as Software Developer at Harman International. Before that, I have worked at Tata Elxsi Ltd. as a Senior Engineer for three years.</br></br>

        With expertiese in design and development of Embedded System and Middleware applications, I've worked on C/C++, Java and Agile/Scrum based environment. I gained a good understanding of Linux and Android architecture while working on Android, Linux and QNX based Platforms.</br></br>

        I have implemented some of the applications by using open source packages like BlueZ, oFono, Automotive Message Broker(AMB). I have also used Dbus(Inter Process Communication mechanism in linux), CommonAPI(a standardized C++ API specification for the development of distributed applications) and GLib(a bundle of low-level system libraries written in C) libraries in linux based infotainment system.
